# Laptop Setup Scripts

This script installs a variety of tools and apps for a new mac.  The tools are largely generic at this point, with some apps added for web / backend / devops work (i.e. VS Code, IntelliJ, terraform, docker, kubectl etc..)

## Future Plans

* Create specific containers or vagrant machines for particular types of work such as GCP / AWS / Azure
